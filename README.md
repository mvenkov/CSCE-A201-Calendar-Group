# CSCE-A201-Calendar-Group

- Navigate to next or previous year
- Automatically starts with the current year

## Dependencies
- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- Standard C++ libraries

## Building and Running

2. Compile the program: with main.cpp and holidays.h in the direcory.


## Usage
- Press 'n' to view the next year
